# Dashboard Overview  
    The sales dashboard is designed to provide an overview of Coca-Cola's sales performance across different regions, brands, and periods. The dashboard is divided into four main sections:
    KPIs, Revenue Breakdown, Regional Sales, and Brand Sales.

# KPIs
    The KPI section displays three key metrics: Revenue, Quantity Sold, and Average Price. These metrics provide a quick snapshot of the company's sales performance.

    Revenue: $8,000,000
    Quantity Sold: 1,500,000 units
    Average Price: $5.33 per unit
    Revenue Breakdown
    The Revenue Breakdown section displays a stacked column chart showing the revenue distribution across different months. The chart reveals that December has the highest revenue, followed by November and 
    October.

# Regional Sales

    The Regional Sales section displays a map of the United States, with bubbles representing the revenue generated by each state. The larger the bubble, the higher the revenue. The map shows that Florida and 
    California is the top-performing state.

# Brand Sales

    The Brand Sales section displays a slicer that allows users to select different beverage brands, such as Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite. The slicer is connected to the other sections of the dashboard, allowing 
    users to drill down into the sales performance of each brand.

# Insights and Recommendations

    Based on the dashboard, here are some insights and recommendations:

    December is a peak sales month, which may be due to holiday season demand. Coca-Cola should consider increasing production and inventory during this period to meet demand.
    Florida and California are the top-performing states, which may be due to their large population and tourist industries. Coca-Cola should consider targeting these states with specific marketing campaigns.
    Fanta and Sprite are underperforming compared to Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola should consider revamping its marketing strategies for these brands or introducing new products to boost sales.

    The dashboard utilizes several Power BI features, including:
 
    Data transformation and loading using Power Query
    Data visualization using charts, maps, and slicers
    Interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities
    AI-powered analytics using the "Explain this increase" feature
    Overall, the sales dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of Coca-Cola's sales performance and allows users to drill down into specific regions, brands, and periods to gain deeper insights.
